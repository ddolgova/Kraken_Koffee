### Project Overview

This report provides an analysis of the performance of Kraken Koffee's three Florida locations. The insights gathered from this report are useful to pinpoint opportunities for performance improvement, to forecast the sales performance for the remainder of the year, identify top performing products, set sales goals, and identify patterns in store attendance volume.

### Data Sources

Kraken Koffee Sales Data: The main dataset used for this report is the “Kraken_Koffee_Sales+-+Excel+Version.xlsx” file, which holds information about sales of Kraken Koffee products in the three flagship Florida stores.

### Tools

- Excel: Data cleaning 
- Power Query Editor: Data cleaning, data modeling
- Power BI: Data analysis, data modeling, report building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the first phase of data preparation, I went through the following procedure:

1. Loading the data and performing the initial assessment
2. Finding and treating missing and null values
3. Data formatting
4. Cleaning unnecessary special characters

### Data Modeling

In the next phase of data preparation, I did the following:

1. Inspecting the source data to determine the best modeling approach
2. Referencing a clean copy of the source data to create the fact and dimension tables
3. Determining the cardinality and relationships between the fact and dimension tables
4. Creating some initial DAX measures
5. Organizing DAX measures by order of complexity, making a table for nested and formatting measures.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA included investigating the housing data to answer the following questions:

- Which Kraken Koffee Products are driving revenue so far in 2023?
- Which product is our strongest seller, and which product is our highest revenue generator?
- At what time of day do our Florida locations see the most revenue?
- What is an appropriate sales goal for 2023 based on current trends and predictions by data forecasting?
- What are some actionable recommendations to improve store performance based on findings in this report?

### Results and Insights

The visualizations resulting from this analysis work well to assist homebuyers in finding a suitable property for purchase based on their selection criteria.
This report also can be utilized by real estate companies, agents, and brokers, to get an overview of the housing market.
Here are some of the insights that appear from the visualizations.
Out of the 15,171 properties, the vast majority - 14,241 - are single family homes.
Multi-family homes had the greatest difference between median and average home price.
The median home price in the Austin, Texas area is $405,000 and the average home price is $512,768.
Properties that are in areas with higher school ratings are on the western side of the Austin, Texas region.
Some of the key influencers in home price increase include having more than 2 stories, more than 4 bedrooms, more than 2 parking/garage spaces, is built before 1957 or after 2017, and lot size/living area increases.
